## Overview
The dataset is used for fine-grained vulnerability localization based on BigVul.  
It contains code functions paired with vulnerability metadata collected from real-world open-source projects.

Due to an associated patent application (No.2024102587930) by Desay SV, only the dataset is released here, without code and models.
